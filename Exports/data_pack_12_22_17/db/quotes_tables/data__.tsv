Their leader, who was bedecked in feathers, edged towards me. It was I who spoke first: "Salaam, brother, we come in peace!" He spoke to me in his own tongue which I could not understand.

The only possible way an attacker can carry one of those accursed stone forts is to advance under the heaviest barrage of missiles possible. This is where the Elf forces archieved their greatest successes; the defenders unable to spread out, are ripe for slaughter beneath a cloud of arrows, and cannot deploy much effective missile fire of their own, hampered by the limited arcs of fire within their walls.	allurian	1871055270
I stood before the gigantic golden statue at last! Here it was, the legendary Golden Serpent, the greatest treasure in all of Lustria. I alone was left alive to see it.

A tale is told of two Skaven, birthkin from the same breeder. While scouting the woods above their home, they encountered a ravenous Minotaur. Wisely, they fled the beast, but it gave chase and pursued them for many miles. "Surely", said the first Skaven, panting, "we cannot-cannot outrun this horrible creature". The second chittered his agreement, "Nor do we have to", he replied. Unsure of his birthkin’s motive, the first Skaven asked, "What do you mean?" By way of response, the second tripped his companion, answering, "I-I only need to outrun you!"	horned_rat_lessons	1939661777

Thwoppa, Thwoppa, Thwoppa - the rhythmic beating of great rotor blades grew in intensity until a squadron of Gyrocopters passed close overhead.

Our mine was saved - the Aircorp of Zhufbar had arrived!	oldor_greybeard	3816

Volkmar. Just look at him. He never wavers and never yields. Some say he never even sleeps. Everything about him is bent to that one great task of holding back the darkness.

I did not see - none of us saw. The arrows flew as from the very trees themselves. My men, they fell, and my legs allowed me to escape. Or did they? Their unfailing accuracy leaves only the conclusion they let me escape, so that I would know…	corbeau	3869
No man is born so unnatural that his body does not revolt at the foul pollution of Undead blood. And by these marks can you tell them: by the fangs of the predator, for their thirst for blood and flesh is like that of a vile beast; by their porcelain white skin, cold to the touch and unnatural to the eye; by the glow of their eyes, behind which lives the terrible Hunger. These are the marks of the Vampire.	ingeheim	3876
Fear me, mortals, for I am the Anointed, the Favoured Son of Chaos, the Scourge of the World. The armies of the Gods rally behind me, and it is by my will and by my sword that your weakling nations shall fall.	archaon	3880
Is not the only constant in the universe change? One day all this will be dust, and even the stars above will flicker and grow dim.

I have been chosen for greatness by the Dark Gods themselves. You, petty mortal, have been chosen only for death.	eglixus	3896
Face me if you dare, stunted whelp, or do you lack even an Elven maid's courage? I thought the Sons of Grungni were great warriors, but perhaps you are no true Dwarf. Indeed, maybe you are instead some breed of bearded Goblin, though in truth I have seen a finer beard on a Troll's back-side.	wulfrick	3906

No man can be judged until he stands alone before his god.	alaric	4103
The daemons of Chaos can be likened to hungry and rabid wolves. The shepherd should not waste his time hating the wolf that attacks his flock. He should simply kill it.	volkmar	4107
At some point in his life, every man finds himself confronted by the reality of evil. The test comes in whether he is willing to face it unflinching, or turn aside and by his inaction let that evil prosper.	captain_helmur_van_hal	4109
It is better to take your own life than to fall into the hands of the Kurgan.	karl_althaus	4115

The Beastmen: they consume order and spit out Chaos in its place.	anon	4246
I looked up into the sky and there I saw my doom, lithesome yet dread. What creatures were these? How many tortures would I endure before peace was mine?

Stamp and trample! Gore and crush!	bhorgos	4255
A seething, roaring, stinking mass of hair and muscle, sprinting and bounding towards us...	eisner	4258
We heard it first. Wailing and mewling. Growling and fading. The trees bucked and cried and I thought they tried to pull up their roots and flee from what drew near. Would that we had been so wise...	reikwald	4268
Shoot it down! For the sake of Sigmar, reload, reload!	udolf	4275

One fell night when Morrslieb leered fat in the sky, Heinrich's body came to resemble that which festered in his soul like a rotting wound, an unhealed scar. Every beast in the village whickered and shrieked in fear that night, but Heinrich's screams were loudest of all, for Morrslieb's caress is not gentle.	onceman	4307
If we run, they will claw us into the dirt and their hounds will gnaw the gristle from our bones. If we surrender, they will bind and bleed us, and Minotaurs will feast on our flesh. If we fight, they will hack and rip and bite and butcher, and they will swallow our still-beating hearts. So many deaths. Which will we choose?	nowl	4312
And so did the fair village of Sternburg come under the hateful, greed-filled gaze of the Beast. Intent these foul Beasts were of naught but the spilling of blood, the burning of houses and the butchery of all. Mayhap they wished to gather foodstuffs and drink, but I believe this beyond their bestial intellect. A night of terrors and tragedy it was for the people of Sternburg...	reinhold	4317
Powerful was its stature, tall and curving were its horns, and filled with hatred and cunning were its eyes, glowing in the night. It lashed about with a barbed whip, the touch of which cut and tore. With a roar, it pointed, and a pack of nightmare dog-beasts turned their feral attention towards me.	renkler	4325
You may have felled the trees. You may have built a wall. But these are the blood-grounds of the Beastmen. They will not rest until your homes are ground beneath their hooves and your chewed flesh is rotting in their guts.	rittlehof	4334
Really the only question is: what gets to eat you?	rittlehof	4337
All around me, they are talking, whispering. Put out their eyes, pluck out their filthy tongues, still they talk, always taunting. Braying in the fields, they plot, they approach in the night, drawing always nearer. They come!	schwalz	4343
And then, the Beastmen were upon us - breaking apart our cannons like they were matchwood. As you can imagine, we ran, lest the disgusting mass consumed us. Only Sigmar knows how we made it to safety, but some were not so nimble in their escape, and paid - screaming - with their lives.	martin_fortberg	4352
Never have I seen such a heaving mass of tusk and flesh, appearing as if from nowhere and careening towards us with truly wild abandon. We had no chance, and I am only alive to speak of it because - to my eternal shame - I ran like a craven coward from the slavering herd.	christof_gamboldini	4354
The hellish, slavering Beastmen warherds are the very embodiment of darkness itself - the Realm of Chaos made manifest.	petrus_staveheart	4358
Within my library there is all knowledge - of gods lost and new, of tyrants and heroes, of lost cities and civilisations... and forbidden lore. Yes, there is wisdom that should not be learnt by the likes of me or you. And yet... shall we take a peek?	andreas_halldenstadt	4368
They call me mad - mad! But 'twas I who stopped those invading unicorns. None other! Mad indeed…	marius_leitdorf	4375
I realised, as my brush drifted over the canvas, that I was no longer painting the likeness of a man, of an Emperor, but of Sigmar himself - reborn!	rineheart_prinzbild	4384
The riving flow of Chaos must be met with order. The purge of heresy and the restoration of civility. Those harbouring impure thoughts must be washed away by the cleansing flame; it is the only way.	petrus_staveheart	4386
They say of Marienburg that a man can find whatever he wants amongst the madding throngs. They also say that a man will almost certainly find what he does not want as part of the bargain…	christof_gamboldini	4391
We have gazed upon the forbidden knowledge of ancient men, of wisened scribes, and powerful fools. All have a place within my library. And then, there are the… darker corners… Do we dare?	andreas_halldenstadt	4398
I have unshakeable faith in the percussive power of the Imperial battery. Yet there are things out there, dark and twisted things, that make me wish they fired just a little faster…	martin_fortberg	4408
Did you know that Sigmar himself worshipped Ulric? Yes, yes - so we're all Sons of the Wolf really. Yes, oh yes, he whispers to me, tells me these things. Secret things…	danric_hattsvainn	4410
Proud Middenheim juts out of the forest atop the Ulricsberg, a proud white lupine fang, defiant. It dares any who would denounce Ulric to try their might; it goads their inevitable failure.	ivan_steinmann	4419
A nightmare in the flesh is Helman Ghorst. I saw him once, I did. Ensconced in a cart pulled not by horses, nor demon steeds, but men. And not just any men - his own dead brothers resurrected! Makes you shudder…	eckhart_blitz	4422
Where march you, men of Reikland, where carry you halberd and sword? We march to war for our Emperor, our saviour and our lord.	empire_soldiers_song	4428
Tomorrow we go to war, to face the hosts of Chaos, Tomorrow we will be buried, in cold graves that await us.	empire_soldiers_song	4432
And when the fighting is done, and the sun goes down at night, Hear my prayer, save my soul, and take me to Sigmar's light.	empire_soldiers_song	4436
The Emperor can only see as far as his gilded throne in Averland will allow. What the Supreme Elector cannot see, cannot hurt him. Not yet, anyway…	dietrich_mirtis	4440
And I beheld a great host descending; a horde of bodies, not one of them complete. An arm missing here, a leg there, a jaw elsewhere; a desiccated mass of horror, tumbling from the mountainside…	essen_ford_survivor	4449
At the zenith of our ancient power, it was a wonder to the world; more beautiful then even Everpeak, open to the sky. A sign of our wealth and power, strong beyond the measure of all. We thought it would never fall and the mines would be ours forever...	gurnisson_glorious	4455
What fools we were. In pride we built Eight Peaks, sure of our mastery of stone and the dark beneath the world. Yet even as we built the city, the seeds of its doom were planted.	gurnisson_inhabitant	4456
We were weary of war when the Black Mountains belched forth their cloud of ash; our people had returned to the safety of their cities. Yet from the heart of our realm, from the place we imagined ourselves the strongest, the foe burst forth...	gurnisson_inhabitant	4464
From the tunnels far below any we had dug, our enemies struck into the core of the fortress. Through the mines that had been the source of our wealth poured armies of Goblins and rat-like Skaven and things far, far worse…	gurnisson_inhabitant	4473
When we first came here we numbered five hundred, with a few mannish allies. The only perils we faced were the Orcs and their followers. We cleared this keep and parts of the upper city as a prelude to reclaiming our ancient mines.	magda_freyadotter	4482
Ach, manling, you have some inkling of how far we have fallen. The days of our glory are behind us. Once we created all this. Now we huddle in a few shrunken cities and wait for the end of the world.	gurnisson_inhabitant	4491
The day of the Dwarf has gone, never to return. We crawl like maggots through the work of elder days and the glory of what once was ours mocks us today.	gurnisson_inhabitant	4499

And this big Orc made of stars, he said, “You!” – ’e shouts lots. “You! Little greeny! Go home! Go home and be da biggest and bestest gobbo since Grom da Paunch flattened da pansies! Go on! Go on home now!” You might fink dat’s nonsense, but it ain’t, oh it ain’t!	skarsnik_life	4521
Down, Gobbla! Soon yoo’ll get to eat. Dere’ll be plenty of stunties to munch on. I got a plan…	skarsnik_squig	4525
I dreamed of opening up the Ungdrin again, so that armies might freely march between my, Kazador’s and Thorgrim’s realms. I dreamed of reopening the mines, of filling the coffers of our Clan with gold and jewels.	belegar_ironhammer	4534
Right, are you ready, my most courageous of kin? We're going to go in there and we're going to kill all the filthy, stinking grobi we set eyes upon, and we're going to take back the Eight Peaks for the glory of Clan Angrund and the Karaz Ankor! Now, are you with me?	belegar_preparing	4535
Some of you will, undoubtedly, die. Well, quite a lot of you, I should think, but when that happens you just make sure you take as many of those green-skinned grobi scumbags with you as you possibly can, by Valaya! Yes?	belegar_assault	4541
A year's supply of Bugman's to the Dawi who brings me Skarsnik's head! Best pick it up by the ears though, I've got a good idea where exactly it's been…	belegar_assault	4542
I hunted the interloper with the practiced gift of my people. His folly was borne in every hurried fumble, every snapped twig. I was the breath of the forest, the rustle of leaves. I was justice.	charoi	4548
All tunnels lead to Skavenblight.	skaven_phrase	4551
There are many who would defile the sanctity of the forest. Dwarfs avariciously crave our sacred timber, while wizards would siphon the energies of our life. All will be expunged. Athel Loren will be defended.	ethalin	4552
Warboss Grak Beastbasha of the Red Snakes tribe was once visited by a vision from Gork (or possibly Mork) that inspired him to lead a horde of more than five thousand sun-crazed Savage Orcs in a march through the jungle to claim the ruins of the temple-city of Itza Chiquita. On their way, they were regularly waylaid, led into the pathway of hunting monsters, and picked off mercilessly by poison darts. It took only seven Chameleon Skinks to ensure that not a single Greenskin from that formidable horde survived. Such are the dangers of Lustria....	lost_waaagh	4555
The forest speaks, to those who listen. We move and dance, anticipating the will of Athel Loren. Through us, the trees and vines talk; we paint their words onto the page.	sarathai	4560
There was once a place beneath Durthu's ancient husk where wisdom and compassion once flourished, and all were better for it. But that is gone now, purged by centuries of malice and war. What remains of Durthu's heart now beats only to avenge.	menlui	4562
In the Skaven world, not unlike our own, the strongest eats the best portion and every other rat plots to take that place for himself.	ammelie_meyer	4567
Athel Loren is at once salvation and damnation. We walk the bough betwixt greatness everlasting and complete annihilation. Only the forest has the answer, and the forest is too-oft silent to the question.	woodwhisper	4569
Please, come in and join me for dinner. I can see from the way you dress, you are a man of exquisite... taste.	isabella_von_carstein	4573
What dwells in the forest that is so 'sacred'? What says we can't have a slice too? The timber in them woods is much needed, and by Grimnir's ancient beard we shall have it…	stonesplitter	4581
Manlings don’t like it, but I find a good squeeze of rats’ blood into the hair and beard keeps the Skaven’s noses confused. Long enough for you to get your axe into their brains, anyway.	behram	4582
They say they live high above our heads, and deep beneath the ground of the forest. It's magic, you know. They weave it to make themselves homes, and to hide from us. I mean, I've never seen them, of course, but that's what they say…	fontaine	4585
Have you seen the Spellsingers move? Or the Wardancers dance? It is a sight to behold; a lesson in beauty, and poetry. And death, of course, almost always certainly death. But, my word, what wonders…	branchclimber	4586
Leave tunnels for the Dwarfs, manlings, or at least take one of us with you if you must go down below. You’ll only get lost down there alone. And there are more horrors in the dark than just the Skaven, trust me.	behram	4587
I take offence at that. Our weapons may not be quite as deadly to our enemies, but that doesn’t mean that our engineering is lesser than the Skaven's. For my money, when a weapon explodes in your hands more often than at the enemy, it’s not much of a weapon at all. Right?	behram	4592
We record the passing of the seasons, but we cannot predict them. It is simply how things are. In many ways, this is like life, no? It moves and changes, but who can say when, or how it will happen.	fleetfoot	4596
They look a lot bigger than you when you’re up close and they’ve got their claws out, especially the big fat ones. But so do Elves and Men. I tell you, Skaven go down a lot easier. All that fur is a ruse - underneath they’re as lean as a Goblin, and just as easily smashed with a good axe-blow.	behram	4598
And King Louen did wield the Sword of Couronne, and he did slay the herds of beasts and the tide of green death that threatened the fair land of Bretonnia! It is written, oh yes - it's all here in the finest scribe's hand!	andreas_halldenstadt	4606
Yes, we fought alongside the Bretonnians. One fellow insisted on calling me "serf" even though I had tactical command. Me and some of the lads unhorsed the swine while no one was looking. He probably hasn't learned his lesson though...	christof_gamboldini	4607
Apparently, we fight with "peasants' weapons" and "without honour from afar". Whatever, I say, the results speak for themselves - they got chopped up and we reduced the Greenskins to a smelly puddle on the battlefield!	martin_fortberg	4612
An army that seeks to fight without the protection of the Eagle Claws is clearly courageous or inept. Either way, I wish no part in it.	eolaran_greyhawk	4614
...And Orion is consumed by flame, only to be born anew; a cycle of regeneration without end. As he emerges once again, he bears the memories of those who have come before; branded by the flame.	silverwing	4617
Those Knights who swear fealty to the Lady, and to the King, ride to defend what was and what will be again.	celeste_verite_damsel	4622
The Lady, though we owe all to her, is ever fickle. 'Tis only to Bretonnians that she does appear, and yet to Bretonnians she will also withhold her grace, should they ever err or stumble on the path. Such is her unfaltering way.	louen_king	4624
The desire for errantry beats in the heart of every noble Bretonnian but not the peasants, you understand? We feel it in every motion, in every step, in every breath. But the peasants, of course, do not. Obviously.	gregoire	4625
I may be small, but I’m strong. Hell, ten years in a Skaven mine makes you damned strong. If I get in close, I can snap their puny necks like a twig. I could teach you Empire boys a thing or two about it, that’s as sure as mutton.	fassbinder	4626
Oh I see them, the Bretonnians. Yes, I see them. In their gilded towers with their shiny banners and their glittering horses. Tosh. Tosh and gaudy nonsense I say! Yet those horses ARE pretty…	markus_leibniz	4629
The Bretonnians? Aye, I know 'em. Arrogant lot, full of fancy ideas about valour and chivalry and what not. Yet they've no love for the grobi, mind you, so that makes 'em a firm friend to the Dawi!	darthon_ironbeard	4634
Listen up boys. In my experience, there are three types of Skaven: white ones, black ones, and everything else. Some may be big, some small, but all die covered in their own pi...	gregor_schmidt	4636
Mousillon was once ruled by a just and even-handed ruler, yet no more. Now that land is blighted; forsaken by the light and all but the most stalwart residents. Death stalks Mousillon, and they call him "My Lord".	petrus_staveheart	4638
The true power of Bretonnian martial ability is displayed in towering trebuchets. No walls, nor gate, nor city can stand against the ceaseless strength of these man-made marvels.	lafayette_taureau	4643
You suck your thumb and your teeth will stick out! And if you don’t stop, you’ll grow whiskers and a snout, too! Where do you think Skaven come from, hmm? They’re all little boys who sucked their thumbs!	frau_wilchers	4646
Many whisper that the Fay Enchantress IS the Lady herself, but she denies these rumours. All the same, she speaks the Lady's will, and knows the Lady's power. Hers is a strength that supports all of Bretonnia.	marcelle_du_nottin	4650
Their slinking, furred shapes infested the broken city, feasting on the fallen and pulling down the weak... The manlings stood back to back and fought for their lives, but against the implacable ferocity and countless numbers of the verminous horde their weapons were useless. The tide of monstrous rats flowed over them one by one, dragging them down to be torn apart, the yellow chisel-teeth sinking into their soft flesh, the dark-furred mass drowning their pitiful screams with their hideous chattering.	doom_of_kavzar	4653
Bretonnia is a realm of men, but 'twould be nothing without the steeds that carry them. And no Bretonnian mount is greater than the Pegasus, the mighty wing'ed beast that carries the questing Knights far afield, across impassable terrain with terrifying strength, in the name of the Lady.	albert_du_maurier	4656
We tread your path, we fight your fights, we climb the highest peaks and delve into the endless depths. Tells us, Lady, what is it we must do? How best to gain your blessing!?	lancelot_pondrecoq	4660
Now that I have seen Lustria with my own eyes I believe the tales are true - both of the gold that can be pried out of every ruin, and also of the denizens of that cursed land. Lizardmen, savage in deed and heart. It matters not the price, I will not return to those forsaken jungles again.	vincenzo_corenzo	4661
So they sent for a witch with a terrible twitch to ask how my future impressed her. She took one look at me and cried, "He, he, he, HE! What else could he be but a jester?" A jester? A jester? A funny idea. No butcher, no baker, no candlestick maker, and me with the look of a fine undertaker impressed her as a jester?	jason_le_wallier	4668
Before Elves, before Dwarfs, before Men, the Old Ones arrived upon this world. Then came Chaos and the Great Plan of the Old Ones was unmade. We are the last of their servants, and only by our hand shall the Great Plan be restored, with the total defeat of the usurping younger races.	hexoatl	4671
We have political systems like this in the Empire. We call them 'protection rackets'…	matthias_von_pfeildorf	4677
I’m not sure what those things were, but they fought like cornered... er...	josef_schneidling	4678
The weak Elves of Ulthuan fear us, for our ways are the true ways. They fear what they cannot understand and instead cower behind the lies of their false history. Fools and cowards, it is but a matter of time before we wipe them from Ulthuan and regain our rightful place as masters of that isle. And from there, we shall take the world.	keress	4680
What is a Knight without his steed? But what is the steed without his knight? Knight and Steed, noble and peasant; on such relationships is Bretonnia built.	louen_king	4681
All that stuff about Cloaked Brothers is bunk. Like the Skaven, they don’t exist.	kleber_reinhard	4684
Our duty is clear. If you cannot stand against them, then we will take a force and destroy these Rat-things that prey upon you. Make way.	lord_adana	4688
Bretonnia is fair and peaceful because everyone knows their place. Yours is with the truffle hounds.	thederic_de_maronz	4691
We shall strike down our foe with sharp steel and cold hearts. The weak die so that the strong shall be spared. Then and only then will our enemies know the true meaning of fear.	malekith	4694
Manlings will fall! Yes-yes... in time...	man_flayer	4702
Dangerous it is, to touch Warpstone often. But that’s what slaves are for, yes-yes?	narshift	4712
Most precious of all substances, the pulse of our life. If the Horned Rat is our father, then surely, Warpstone is our mother. Its uses are infinite. Like the heart of an endless fire, it is.	narshift	4714
Our beautiful land is besieged on all sides, but we resist like our fathers did before us. We will emerge victorious and more intractable than ever to these turbulent times when our corrupt brothers come to ravage our shores. We are Asur; the sons of Aenarion and Ulthuan shall never fall. 	tyrion	4715
Sometimes – you might think I’m as crazy as a doom prophet – but sometimes I think those rats are watching me. You know, spying like. Sigmar preserve me, but I don’t like it much. I’d hate to see it if the rodents ever got their way. Still, I get paid for catching a pole-full. Give us another one, Bessie.	ludwig_nusbaum	4717
The hunting of vermin is a task for peasants, not for a Knight of Our Lady.	phillipe_de_blois	4725
Oh my brothers, what need be said? We are the chosen of our Master, the true Lord of Decay, whose seat remains always-always filled upon the Council of Thirteen. Other seats may change hands, but His will always remain, and no-none other can lay claim to it. We speak His truths. We hear His thoughts. We know His purpose. We are the guides of our people, the spiritual compass that guides-leads them to their destinies as killer-masters of the world.	skreelin_thurntik	4733
The horrors and the wonders they must have seen, these Phoenix Guard. How I wish they would only speak of it to mortals not gifted with such foresight.	herwig_algnar	4736
To sail with a Black Ark is one of the greatest honours that any Druchii could ever aspire to. I trained long and hard to earn my berth upon the Wind of Damnation, slaying several undeserving rivals to the post along the way. It is a worthy life. I get to regularly practice my skills upon our many enemies and one tenth of the plunder that I seize is mine to keep. Slaves, gold, and fame, these too can be yours if you are bold.	teilancarr	4742
You disappoint me, Queek. To be a Lord of Decay is not to stab and kill and smash all things aside. You lack circumspection. You are a killer, nothing more.	gnawdwell	4748
You were so magnificent when I found you, the biggest in your litter, and they were all large before you ate them. I raised you, I fed you the best Dwarf-meat and Man-flesh. And you have become even more magnificent. Such courage. There is none other like you, Queek. You are unnaturally brave. Others think you freakish for leading from the front, not the back. But I do not. I am proud of my Queek.	gnawdwell	4749
At the time of the three hundredth cycle of this world, the two moons shall unite and summon forth the rodent god and his evil spawn to deliver plague and pestilence upon the land named Lustria.	prophecy_of_sotek	4752
Can’t you hear them? The scratching? The skittering? The squeeking? They are under our very feet!	sarathai	4753
Please, come in and join me for dinner. I can see from the way you dress, you are a man of exquisite... taste.	isabella_von_carstein	4756
Skaven society is tyranny moderated by assassination.	corbeau	4758
We are the chosen of Asuryan, beloved of the gods and heirs to the world. Our armies are the finest in creation; swift where our foes are lumbering, cultured where they are barbaric. Give no thought to failure, nor defeat – we are the Children of Ulthuan and we shall prevail.	silverwing	4760
Yes-yes Warlord Krizk – for a treaty-pledge of just 200 Slaves, twelve claws of Warptokens, a Breeder and certain alliances and pledges, one of our very-very finest Clan Moulder Rat Ogres can be yours...	haggle_master	4764
At the time of the three hundredth cycle of this world, the two moons shall unite and summon forth the Rodent God and his evil spawn to deliver plague and pestilence upon the land named Lustria.	sotek_prophecy	477074157
An Ancient blade shattered in the War of the Beard, almost symbolic of that feud. Forged by the Dwarfs, enchanted by the Elves, broken by their conflict.	tyrion	554889164
It has been mostly my pleasure to meet you all, though I have not a clue what your names are, and all of you look pretty much the same to me.	malekith_karak_address	752804730
We found it the ruins of the Kalak Wastes. I know not its significance, only that it-even such a small piece-radiates power.	bilgarim_whitestar	839009022
Kill them. Kill them all.	malekith	84192767
Pass me another Itxi grub.	lord_ztlocutec	871484687
They should not be here.	lord_huinitenuchli	952386552
Amid the darkness and horror of a world splintering apart, the armies of the true creators, we who were ancient at the dawn of time, will march forth once more. We shall sweep away all that is chaos and disorder, for ours is the true path, and none shall defy us.	lord_kroak	972589836
All decent folk find the common rat repulsive. Harbinger of disease, it scavenges on our waste-heaps and frightens our children. How immeasurably worse then is the foul Skaven - standing on its hindlegs in foul parody of a human. Rats as tall as man, and blessed with the most vile intellect and cunning. They are the dark side of our souls, come to destroy us for our sins.	albrecht_of_nuln	980905120
Your doom is coming, Man-things.	anon	986647988
