False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_battlefield	After a large battle, bodies litter the ground and the stench of death fills the air. It appears that the defenders were protecting the entrance to a small warehouse. Pondering on its contents, you wonder whether it was really worth dying for...

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_black_dragons_nest	High above some deserted and treasure-less ruins, on a rocky outcrop overlooking the once-grand fortress, one of your warriors discovers a Black Dragon's nest. After hiking up the mountain you find the nest and a clutch of unhatched eggs! If you can get them away undisturbed, they will more than make up for the disappointment of the empty ruins below.	One Egg or Two?	wh2_treasure_hunt_3	True	TreasureHunt_DarkElves		
False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_dwarfen_vaults	After much searching through the ruins of the destroyed settlement, you come across an underground passageway.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_effigy_to_gork_or_mork	Whilst scouting the outskirts of the ruined city, you notice in the distance an Orc Shaman prancing around a campfire nearby.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_flooded_armoury	The defenders of this newly-ruined city were certainly anticipating a long siege; your search reveals an enormous underground armoury, deep within a submerged vault.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_graveyard	Whilst scouting the outskirts of a recently-ruined settlement you notice, on the edge of town, a small, secluded graveyard.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_halls_of_the_lizardmen	This strange continent holds many secrets, vast riches, and a myriad traps to ensnare the unprepared.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_hidden_chaos_shrine	Cautiously, you head into the ruins, knowing that many of this city's former inhabitants were lost in thrall to the Chaos Gods, and that in such places, their Ruinous influence can oft still be felt. As if by Dark Magic, hidden within the basement of one of the buildings you find a shrine to Slaanesh, the Dark Prince himself.	Perverse Practitioners of Excess	wh2_treasure_hunt	True	TreasureHunt		
False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_hidden_tunnel	Whilst searching through the ruins you find a hidden tunnel in the basement of an old building.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_lone_wanderer	Cautiously searching the rubble-strewn streets of the once-great city, you notice an ethereal breeze blowing.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_picked_clean	Although this city is only a recent addition to the many desirable ruins found across the world, it is obvious that you are not the first to search this place.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_she_daemon_lair	Whilst hunting for treasure in the ruins of an ancient city, you find a hideous, putrid Daemon of Nurgle slumped in a cage, its pox riddled flesh oozing through the bars.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_skaven_ambush	Deep within the ruins of a recently destroyed city, you send a scouting party to investigate a nearby tunnel entrance.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_skaven_burrow	Deep within the ruins lies an abandoned Skaven burrow.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_spider_nest	Beneath the ruins lie a series of caverns; as you explore, you begin to notice an increasing number of large cobwebs.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_the_tattered_library	In the midst of this ruined city you find a library.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_tomb_of_the_mummy	Venturing down into the dank, dimly-lit catacombs beneath the ruined city, you discover an ornate tomb.

False	wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_trapped_survivor	As you search through the remains of a collapsed colonnade, cries for help echo through the rubble - people are trapped beneath!

True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_court_of_the_sea	Representatives from the coastal kingdom of Cothique come before the court. Cothique Elves are hardy and weathered by the sea; they care little for the machinations of court, and so other, more 'refined' Elves gossip and giggle, not-quite out of sight. Yet the Cothiquian request is just, and their presentation courteous enough. How to deal with these other, disrespectful courtiers?	Court of the Sea	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_favour_of_the_phoenix	The courtiers align themselves before the court, all vying for royal attention and favour. Sycophantic, but necessary. The Everqueen cares not for such pandering, and so the dispensation of favour falls to the Phoenix King. The mages of Caledor, the horsemasters of Ellyrion, and the stalwart defenders of Cothique all prostrate themselves before him and he asks you whom he should favour.	Favour of the Phoenix	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_in_fighting	A dispute has developed between the nobles of Saphery and Yvresse, whom the Sapherian Elves call the 'ghosts of glory'. Although the petty, clandestine squabbles of lower houses are never usually a concern for the Phoenix King, the Sapherian Elves bristle with magical power, whilst Tor Yvresse is one of the most defensible, if dangerously ill-garrisoned, cities in Ulthuan. Harmony between these two houses is preferable but, if not possible, then someone, somewhere must be appeased.	In-Fighting	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_life_in_the_lagoon	Courtiers are often expected to spend large stretches of time at court, living and operating under the suffocating political intrigue of Lothern. The messengers of the Phoenix King are able to weave throughout the lodgings of the courtiers, disseminating information that helps or hinders them. Likewise, the king can make life comfortable for certain courtiers, or extremely unpleasant. All is at his whim...	Life in the Lagoon	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_retainer_of_power	The seneschal of the court controls the flow of information to and from the Phoenix King; he is, therefore, an important figure with great power. It is discovered that the seneschal has been choosing which information reaches the court, in order to maintain his power and reduce that of others. It is a shrewd tactic, but courtiers are only as smart as the secrets they hide. Once exposed, they are powerless.	Retainer of Power	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_signed_sealed_delivered	It has been discovered that the Keeper of the Seal, who controls the officiating of all documents with the mark of Lothern, has been abusing his position, using the seal on menial, personal documents to enhance his power and prestige. Exposing him would condemn the man, but perhaps there are ways this can be worked to the king's advantage...?	Signed, Sealed, Delivered	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_caledor_question	Whenever the envoys of Caledor are at court, fractious are the proceedings. They refuse to dip their flags to the Phoenix King, choosing instead to reference Caledor the Conqueror, who they say earned them the right to do as they please. Their arrogance is astounding, their insubordination infuriating, yet the Order of Vaul hail from Caledor, and their magical skills must never be underestimated, nor their loyalty imperilled.	The Caledor Question	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_court_of_many_kings	Every realm of Ulthuan sends nobles and representatives to the court of Lothern. Every realm is a kingdom in itself, and their leaders kings. They approach Lothern with such a mentality; how the Phoenix King treats these egos is vital to the development and stability of all of Ulthuan.	The Court of Many Kings	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_folly_of_youth	A young prince, impetuous and unknowing of the ways of court, has flown in the face of the order of precedence, speaking out against his elders publicly. Naturally, scandal has ensued. The Phoenix King is not required to wade into the hierarchical scuffles of the court, yet this prince shows promise - it would be unfortunate if he fell from grace due to his naive impropriety...	The Folly of Youth	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_hunt_and_the_hunter	The Phoenix King entertains the court to a great hunt, taken amongst the forests of Avelorn. The Elves of Chrace naturally excel at the sport, yet they are widely derided by the others for their prowess; the Master of the Hunt finds them especially odious. As one particularly mighty beast dives from the foliage, everyone lets loose their arrows. The beast is dead, a messenger reports, but it is uncertain who landed the killing blow. What do you recommend the Phoenix King tells them?	The Hunt & the Hunter	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_would_be_suitor	A noble prince of Ellyrion presents himself before the court, offering the courtship of his eldest, and certainly most beautiful, daughter. It is not forbidden for the Phoenix King, once married to the Everqueen, to take additional consorts, yet to do so would send an interesting message - one that could not be easily undone. All the same, it is clear this prince wishes to curry favour, yet the entire court observes the action of the Phoenix King; what he chooses to do may have repercussions.	The Would-Be Suitor	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_they_who_whisper	High Elves at court partake in many manipulations to achieve their ends. A common tool is to employ lesser Elves and servants as go-betweens; whispering little birds carrying messages. This is not unexpected, but when one of these messengers is intercepted or revealed, there can be no choice but to excoriate them, to save oneself. Having one such messenger revealed, how do you advise the Phoenix King responds?	They Who Whisper	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_wed_to_etiquette	The Phoenix King and Everqueen have received an invitation to the wedding of a court Noble. The King does not care much for them, but it would be impolite to not attend. Attending, however, requires that he bring a lavish gift for them. Whispers say that the engaged noble fancies himself a scholar, with a penchant for arcane and magical tomes. This would endear the Phoenix King to the betrothed-to-be, but there are perhaps other gifts that other guests would consider more impressive...	Wed to Etiquette	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_whispers_of_the_mourning_chorus	One of the princes of Tiranoc has perished whilst hunting. He was a forthright and well-liked fellow, yet known for his streaks of arrogance and foolhardiness. His death is a terrible loss to the Tiranoc nobility, who hold themselves rigid with the starch of past glory. The Phoenix King and Everqueen are, of course, invited to attend the burial rites, yet how they participate is discussed with much fervour amongst the court.

True	wh2_main_hef_intrigue_you_can_dance	At a great masque to celebrate Vaul, the Maker, the floor is cleared so that the Phoenix King and Everqueen may dance together.

True	wh2_main_lzd_a_deadly_price	The mystical Slann Mage-Priests have devised a new ritual to increase the speed and agility of your mighty Saurus warriors on the battlefield.

True	wh2_main_lzd_a_tainted_bounty	The delving of your industrious Skinks brings to light an ancient metal ore: could this substance have been brought to the world by the Old Ones themselves? When subjected to your advanced weaponsmithing process the ore makes highly-effective arrowheads and javelin points. However, once you start to use them some of your usually-hardy Saurus warriors fall ill, raising questions over its safety and even whether it was planted deliberately by the enemies of the Great Plan. Will you continue to use it?	A Tainted Bounty	land_defeat	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_lzd_ancient_skills	Whilst studying some newly-recovered ancient plaques, your Skinks have rediscovered long-lost building techniques that will enable the swift construction of high pyramids and mighty ziggurats, the likes of which have not been seen within Lustrian temple-cities for ages past. Generally, such constructions rise slowly. Will you employ these new techniques or not?	Ancient Skills	diplomacy	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_lzd_blood_sacrifice	Relations with a nearby settlement have deteriorated; their interpretation of the Great Plan may be at odds with the Old Ones' intentions. Your Slann Mage-Priests inform you of a new ritual to recharge the Geomantic Web, but the price is a sacrifice. Will you raid for captives and sacrifice them or leave your neighbours be, as time may yet prove your vision correct?	Blood Sacrifice	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_lzd_born_killers	This latest spawning of Saurus warriors appear to be far more belligerent than any you remember in recent times. Ferocity and resolve are called for when combating the foe, but your forces must also consider the Great Plan's higher purpose and not sacrifice themselves unduly.

True	wh2_main_lzd_charging_in	The fervour of your great Saurus warriors to combat agents of the Ancient Enemy is admirable, though it is starting to verge on fanaticism in some divisions, risking mistakes that could allow Chaos a greater purchase on Lustria's sacred jungles and temple-cities. Is such recklessness in keeping with the Great Plan or should the Slann Lord Mage-Priests instruct their underlings to instil caution in the ranks?	Charging In	army_morale_up	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_lzd_knowledge_regained	The discovery of an ancient plaque has revealed lost knowledge which may increase the magical effectiveness of the great Slann Mage-Priests - not by much, but even a small Geomantic advantage may contribute to the advancement of the Great Plan. However, such things are expensive to research and so must be carefully considered. Will you commit your precious resources in furtherance of the Old Ones' designs, or is such a minimal gain not worth the cost?	Knowledge Regained	politics	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_lzd_magic_for_blades	The mystical Slann Mage-Priests have devised a new ritual to increase the effectiveness of the blades wielded by your Saurus warriors on the battlefield. However, such advances always come at a price; the ritual will siphon much-needed power from the Geomantic Web, potentially putting the Great Plan under threat. Will you use it or not? 	Death Magic for Adepts	messenger	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_lzd_new_blood	The signs are clear. The eternal war once again swerves in Lustria's direction; those that threaten to unmake the progress of the Great Plan gain power and prominence. Their designs must be countered. Do you wish to swell the warriors' ranks or bring forth a Saurus or Skink Hero to coldly annihilate the foe by fair means or foul?

True	wh2_main_lzd_one_shot	Your Slann Mage-Priests' researches reveal the whereabouts of a distant but accessible plaque recording a ritual, usable once, which will powerfully defend your greatest Saurus Scar-Veteran against agents of the Ancient Enemy.

True	wh2_main_lzd_out_or_in	Word comes of a new Norscan incursion; those foul servants of the Ancient Enemy, who revel in barbarism, have gained a foothold in Lustria and must be cast out! Their small coastal encampment could be easily eradicated, but many of your number are about to leave in search of a plaque of paramount import. As such, will you commit your forces to destroy the warmbloods or recover the relic and learn of the Old Ones' sacred intentions?	Servants of the Hound	blockaded	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_lzd_reclaiming_the_lost_world	Your noble Slann Mage-Priests have devised a ritual that will give even ordinary Skinks increased immunity against some of the foul diseases lingering in territories overrun by the vile servants of the Great Horned Rat. However, they must still be defended against other threats in the abandoned temple-cities. Ground could be regained this way, though troops would have to be committed in the Skinks' defence.

True	wh2_main_lzd_seal_or_strike	Scouts have located a minor branch of the Druchii's Black Way emerging deep in your territory. Allowing allies of the Ancient Enemy so near your heartlands is unacceptable - the spread of Ruinous corruption cannot be allowed and risks the cornerstones of the Great Plan for all time!

True	wh2_main_lzd_skilled_forces	Rumours reach you of forces loyal to your Ancient Enemy, the Ruinous Ones, obtaining a vile, corrupted foothold on Lustrian soil.

True	wh2_main_lzd_the_greater_good	Skinks have uncovered a fell lode that has the stench of Clan Pestilens about it. Plague strikes down all who go near it; many useful artisan Skinks have already been lost, and more are at risk. Quarantine would stop this malady in its foul tracks and frustrate the designs of the insidious Plaguelords, but the trapped artisans would be lost to the Great Plan for now. Alternatively, you could evacuate your Skinks to safety, a course which keeps their numbers high but risks the pestilence spreading elsewhere.	The Greater Good	civilisation_down	False	Event		
True	wh2_main_lzd_war_babies	Recent spawnings have favoured the artisan Skinks over the Saurus warrior-caste. Indeed, workers are important to the Great Plan, but the world is threatened from within also and must be defended.

True	wh2_main_lzd_ways_and_means	The priests of Sotek, ever mindful of the need to press the Serpent God's cause on the field of battle, are uneasy at certain technological developments you believe to be part of the Great Plan; they counsel a more martial focus if the Old Ones' designs are to be realised and the Ancient Enemy kept at bay.

True	wh2_main_lzd_which_hero	The Great Plan must be brought to fruition; as many Skinks as possible must be spawned and set to work if the Old Ones' sacred goals are to be achieved.

But how best to display such power? Through a bloody massacre or the tempting of Dark Magic and the promise to share?	The Carstein Ring	generic	False	Quest		
True	wh_dlc05_wef_asrai_asur_druchii	Carried by elegantly-hewn ships, our cousins have travelled from the distant lands of Ulthuan to visit us. After so many long years, they have finally deigned to visit their forest brethren. Is this a gracious visit, or an omen of arrogance? Do you consider this a slight or a blessing?

True	wh_dlc05_wef_children_of_eternity	The Asrai have long had a… patchy relationship with the denizens of the forest. Whilst often the two peoples get along harmoniously, there have been issues. Lately, malevolent Dryads have taken to kidnapping Elven children for fun. When brought to justice they remain unrepentant - it is their forest, they say. To burn them would anger the forest, but surely they must be made to pay for their crimes against the Asrai?	Children of Eternity	politics	False	Event		
True	wh_dlc05_wef_festival_of_the_equinox	Interlopers into the Trickster's Woods have been caught and brought before you to face justice. The sentence is clear: death. Yet before you can pass judgement, one of the captives issues a brazen challenge; if he can last one hour in battle with a Wardancer, then he and his friends go free.

True	wh_dlc05_wef_heavens_or_the_underworld	The Asrai wish to erect a new shrine within Athel Loren, to give praise to the gods they so faithfully serve. Yet the question is posed - to whom should this shrine be dedicated? The two frontrunners are Asuryan or Khaine, yet ultimately the choice is yours.

True	wh_dlc05_wef_shape_shifters	The Elves of the Skymark Reaches, Cavaroc, come to you with a proposal. These subjects of Lord Edrael have ever been brash; always the first into battle and the last to apologise, yet their latest endeavours are somewhat more… nefarious. They wish to subvert the Bretonnian Dukedom of Quenelles by planting shapeshifting forest spirits amongst the court as Damsels. Such a sneaky scheme is sure to wreak havoc amongst the Bretonnians, which may be to our advantage. Do you wish to aid them, or not?	Shape-Shifters	messenger	False	Event		
True	wh_dlc05_wef_the_dreaming_wood	A young Glade Lord, full of hope and naivety, wishes to journey into the Dreaming Wood to recover a lost artefact. Headstrong and confident, perhaps to the point of arrogance; the Dreaming Wood is a twisted domain ruled by the Prince of Pleasure, Slaanesh - to enter is to dance with the Chaos God of madness and desire. Most who enter never return, claimed body and soul by the forces of Ruin. Yet this Glade Lord seems self-assured - do you allow them to recover this item or forbid the journey?

True	wh_dlc05_wef_the_fate_of_the_body	As with all things of the natural world, a denizen of the forest has shed their mortal shell and become one with the woods. Yet the question remains of how to honour the body, now that they have passed. They could be sacrificed in the flames, immolated as Orion is each year - a warrior's pyre - or the body could be planted deep within the ground, allowing the hungry roots of the Deepwood to draw strength from the mouldering remains...

True	wh_dlc05_wef_the_great_stag	The Great Stag is a revered and treasured creature of Athel Loren; renowned for its magical, ethereal properties, many say it represents the soul of the forest itself.

If you are wrong about the locations to the northwest and we should find no dragon's corpse to serve me into death, I shall feast upon your soul". It seems that the Undead Lord is searching for new materials for use in his foul Necromancy. It would seem that the dead have found at least two possible locations for what they seek and are now moving to claim their vile prize.
