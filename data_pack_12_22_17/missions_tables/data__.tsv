False	wh2_main_def_malekith_circlet_of_iron_stage_1	The Great Vortex falters. It is vulnerable and the Witch King seeks to take advantage - to enter and channel its energies - to wrest the power of Chaos from the Gods themselves! Before Malekith can do this, he must imbue the Circlet of Iron - an ancient band older than the Elves - with an unholy crux.\n\nWhile Malekith knows that a crux is needed before he can enter the Vortex, frustratingly, he lacks knowledge of this arcane boon's location. He must consult an oracle, kept by the Sorceresses, and their services do not come cheap, even if you are the Witch King.

He demands a more specific location with a threat that Ghrond will burn if a satisfactory answer is not given. The Death Hags look unmoved - they know that Ghrond is Morathi’s city, and that her son would not risk her wrath. Perhaps they do not know the Witch King?

False	wh2_main_def_malekith_circlet_of_iron_stage_3	Following a display of Malekith’s temper, the Death Hags are suddenly more forthcoming. Malekith must indeed travel northwards, to the Altar of Ultimate Darkness - a shrine of pure Chaos. The power residing within the altar must be absorbed by the Circlet of Iron, before it can, ironically, be used against the Chaos Gods should Malekith step into the Vortex and take dominion.

False	wh2_main_def_malekith_destroyer_stage_1	Destroyer was forged by the Witch King himself, as a symbol of his determination to rid the world of High Elven kin. The touch of the Destroyer is especially potent against mages. It is a momentous piece of weapon-smithing and yet it has never been blessed by the Elven Maker-God, Vaul.\n\nMalekith considers it a great insult that the god has not deigned to heap praise upon him for his great work. The Witch King, while brooding about this, decides to salve his mood with an outing…	Destroyer	EARN_X_AMOUNT_FROM_RAIDING	rom_event_mission.png	bst/generic	True	Quest		0	0	True	0	2140784854	False	False
False	wh2_main_def_malekith_destroyer_stage_2	The raids prove a vague distraction, as do the screams of the slaves, but with the Vortex swirling out of control, Malekith cannot afford such time ruminating. He decides to tackle Vaul’s snub head on; If the god will not come to him, then he shall force matters. To start with, Destroyer will need to be slaked in much blood.

False	wh2_main_def_malekith_destroyer_stage_3	Vaul’s Anvil is a volcano within which lies the shrine of the Elven smith god. It is the most sacred of sites, and now the Witch King has it in his sights. With Destroyer in hand, he marches relentlessly upon Ulthuan’s shores, to the tip of the Dragon Spine Peninsula and into the volcano itself. As expected, the High Elf guardians are waiting within.

False	wh2_main_def_malekith_supreme_spellshield_stage_1	The Witch King has been without his Spellshield for a few centuries after losing it in the southern lands whilst fighting the reptiles over tablets of lost lore. While its loss bothers Malekith, it doesn't trouble him greatly, for he is the owner of countless arcane artefacts.\n\nHowever, now it has been found – well, according to the Dreadlord, Strenious Kingslayer, it has. He brazenly enters the Black Council’s chamber and approaches the obsidian table – where the Witch King sits with his most loyal advisors – proclaiming that he knows the Supreme Spellshield’s whereabouts and will share it for a price. In the chamber sit a hundred Lords, none of whom can remember such an audacious attempt to provoke the Witch King; many see Strenious’ life lasting only seconds more!\n\nYet Malekith does not unleash his legendary rage.

Malekith makes a great show of thanking the Captain, and pays him then and there. As Strenious smiles upon the wealth he’s suddenly accumulated, the Witch King grabs the captain by the throat and casually throws him over the side of the great vessel. His fortune follows him into the sea, for Malekith cares not for riches, it is power he has always craved.\n\nStrenious’ crew do not bat an eyelid at their master’s sudden death, but quickly make themselves busy when the Witch King orders his army disembarked for an expedition to retrieve the lost shield.

Yet such rumours have a tendency to grow like a spider's web, catching larger flies. Soon the talk of the courts is that Tyrion is no campaigner. While those in battle may fear the Defender of Ulthuan - on grander strategies, such as depriving the foe of hideaways or destroying enemy supply routes, Tyrion is clueless - or so the rumours asserted.

Nevertheless, when a summons comes from Lord Mazdamundi, the oldest and most powerful of all living Mage-Priests, Kroq-Gar is duty-bound to answer.\n\nThe command from Mazdamundi is weak, no doubt a result of the Great Warding’s disintegration, which in turn is due to the fading Vortex on the High Elf Isle of Ulthuan.

A pair of Great Eagles are dispatched from Saphery with the crown securely held their claws. An epic journey follows, crossing the Great Ocean and then the continent itself.\n\n Perhaps it was inevitable, on a flight that long, that the Eagles would not reach Teclis. Something has gone wrong - the crown and its winged escort are lost. An artefact of such power and reverence cannot be allowed to simply vanish. Teclis knows of a ritual of Isha that should be invoked, for a mother always knows where her children lie, and the War Crown is of Isha's making.

Some turn their noses up and even consider returning to the surface, but Teclis gives them a stern look and bids they advance further into the depths.\n\nA piercing scream echoes through the cavern; the master of the lair is in residence! Bones drop from the ceiling to come crashing amidst the High Elven host. The carcasses of two Eagles litter the cavern floor. Teclis looks up to see the hunter that ripped them from the sky - a gigantic Undead bat…\n\nBut even this beast does not seem to be alone, for in the shadows, scuttling all around the periphery of the cave, the Elves hear mocking chitters!

Reports of coastal raids are flooding into Lothern and even that the Witch King is now abroad. Fear spreads that Dark Elves land upon Ulthuan and are trying inveigle themselves into the populace - ready to pounce upon neighbours when bidden by Malekith.\n\nFinubar calls his unofficial war council of which Tyrion is the central pillar.

Nevertheless, when a summons comes from Lord Mazdamundi, the oldest and most powerful of all living Mage-Priests, Kroq-Gar is duty-bound to answer.\n\nThe command from Mazdamundi is weak, no doubt a result of the Great Warding’s disintegration, which in turn is due to the fading Vortex on the High Elf Isle of Ulthuan.

However, since the forked-tongue comet of Sotek was seen in the heavens, the spear’s power has waned.

Matters are not helped by the Rod of Corruption’s recent inability to cast rust upon metal. Flesh will still slough from bones when struck, but where before metal would oxidise and corrode, it remains gleaming.

Uncovering a set of heretical manuscripts, he learned a terrible truth which drove him to an unquenchable fury. Rejecting his former gods, he swore himself to the service of Chaos instead. Tearing down the temple, Archaon vowed to become the scourge of the Empire.

Archaon has vowed to become this man, or die in the attempt. Having cut a bloody swathe across the Empire, he has entered the dreaded Chaos Wastes.

Dire storm clouds gather around the peaks and crags where the Mountain God is said to slumber, yet Suneater is not fully awake. Before a great chasm that splits the mountains like a gigantic axe wound, hundreds upon hundreds of Northmen kneel in the pelting hail and snow, chanting sonorously as tribute after screaming tribute is hurled bodily down into the cavernous lair. Over the chanting rises another voice, distorted to guttural inhumanity. As a Sorcerer servant of the Ruinous Powers completes the summoning, rocks explode as a cataclysmic lightning bolt lances down.

False	wh_dlc01_chs_prince_sigvald_auric_armour_stage_1	Prince Sigvald the Magnificent is bored. The Chaos Wastes are all well and good as far as such things go, but they lack certain comforts that a man of Sigvald’s refined tastes has come to expect. Sigvald is the chosen scion of Slaanesh, the Dark Prince of Chaos. Known as the Lord of Excess, Slaanesh is the master of passions and sensual indulgence, but also of cruel torments and despairing agony. He is the patron of the obsessive, and his attention is drawn to those who inflict pain to satisfy their own desires. As the adopted son of Slaanesh, Sigvald is the personification of beauty on the outside, but rot within. He is attended by dozens who attend to his every whim and desire, but a man can never have too many admirers. As he stands in the midst of battle, preening and murmuring compliments to himself while beings die all around him, he has a whim to gather to himself a band of perfectly-skilled retainers to share in this adulation, perhaps holding mirrors that he might see himself more clearly.

But it is also a place of squalor, of mud, blood and ordure. In every battle, Sigvald is constantly inconvenienced by the need to clean some vile taint from his otherwise spotless armour, be it dirt or the lifeblood of his latest victim. These interruptions are irksome in the extreme and they deprive his followers of precious moments in which to admire and praise their Lord’s perfection. Reluctantly, the Geld-Prince summons a Chaos Sorcerer to advise him. Though the man bears unsightly mutations and cannot be described as sweet-smelling, the fact that he has traded his very soul in servitude to the magic of the Dark Gods means that he may be able to suggest a solution.

At the head of the Cult is the Grand Theogonist, and while many have filled the role over the years, most - if not all - have been intimidating men; full of fury and bombast, and piously devoted to Sigmar's tenets.\n\nShould the Empire come under threat, then it is not always state troops that must face the threat alone. The Cult of Sigmar has often answered the call to war, with the Grand Theogonist at its head, eager as any of his Warrior Priests to smite the foe. It was on one such doomed campaign that the Jade Griffon - a talisman of the Theogonist's office, said to have been blessed by Magnus the Pious himself - went missing. The Grand Theogonist at the time was brought low by Chaos filth, and the Jade Griffon lost somewhere in Kislev.\n\nMany years later, and word has reached Volkmar the Grim that the Jade Griffon has resurfaced. The Grand Theogonist senses that the time is right to go in search of this precious antiquity. Volkmar issues a proclamation that he intends to march for Kislev. In the vanguard of his force go the desperate and the fanatical - those that have lost everything but their faith. Let their zeal light the way.

False	wh_dlc04_emp_volkmar_the_grim_staff_of_command_stage_1	There has always been a darkness about Volkmar. Not for nothing is he known as "the Grim". Those who know Volkmar well, such as Karl Franz, realise that this brooding nature is a fierce internal piety, frustration that Chaos still thrives and a grim determination to purge the Empire's foes. Yet the office of the Grand Theogonist has always attracted enemies, from both within and without. Volkmar, a man who has never suffered fools, has burned alliances and gained many opponents during Altdorf's courtly political games, so when the malicious rumours started to circulate about Volkmar's behaviour, there were many suspects.\n\n The rumours were few at first, but have since spread like balefire - "Volkmar communes with Daemons"; "The Grand Theogonist wishes to depose the Emperor"; "He is the arch-heretic". Despite the Emperor's urging, Volkmar refused to waste time defending himself from such vapid gossip. This played into his unseen enemy's hands, and now the Staff of Command - the symbol of the Grand Theogonist's august office - has been reluctantly taken and locked away by the Holy Order of Sigmar, such is the feeling against Volkmar. Even Franz, his closest friend, is politically tied to remain a mere observer whilst the Witch Hunters investigate the allegations, baseless as they are.\n\nSpurred on by strong support within the Cult of Sigmar, Volkmar has at last decided he must act and despatches loyal Warrior Priests throughout the realm to track down the deviant rumour-mongers.

A few tales by wary villagers back in Reikland tell of priests of the Wolf God, Ulric, besmirching Volkmar's name. Tensions between the two cults are often fraught but cordial. However, ever since Volkmar and his Arch Lectors voted against the Ar-Ulric's candidate in the election for Emperor, relations have been strained.\n\nIf the Cult of Ulric is spreading these fell rumours, then Volkmar will need the support of the Arch Lectors once more.

False	wh_dlc04_vmp_helman_ghorst_liber_noctus_stage_1	The Plague of Blue Roses is a vile disease, sadly common throughout the southern provinces and Tilea. Once its spores have been inhaled, mortal men will quickly perish in a matter of hours, the tell-tale bluish fungus bruises covering their bodies. So it was that a young Helman Ghorst discovered his father and four brothers lying in their beds, taken by the Plague. In a fit of anguish, Helman embraced his dead kin - desperate to contract the plague himself - but fate had other plans for the youngest of the Ghorst family.\n\nUnable to accept his family's deaths, Ghorst sought other, darker means to bring them back. Years later, Helman crossed paths with Mannfred. The Vampire Count saw something in Ghorst, a potential ally perhaps? To that end, he gave Ghorst the Liber Noctus, the Cursed Book of Necromancy. Yet the pages of greatest lore were missing - torn from their binding and scattered across the Empire. No doubt this was Mannfred's true agenda all along - a test - and should Ghorst be successful, he would imbue one of the Nine Books of Nagash with great power once more.\n\nGhorst must begin the hunt for the missing pages immediately or risk disappointing the Gravelord, Mannfred, himself. Fast-moving Dire Wolves will allow the Necromancer to cover more ground.	Liber Noctus	ARMY_CONTAINS_N_UNITS_OF_TYPE	rom_event_mission.png	vmp/generic	True	Quest		0	0	True	0	2140784146	False	False

It was the birthplace of many a Waaagh! that has gone on to devastate Dwarf and humie kingdoms alike. While a Waaagh! can occur ‘naturally’ sometimes these things need a catalyst. For years, that catalyst has been Wurrzag, 'Da Great Green Prophet'. \n\nHowever, word has reached the Savage Orc Shaman that some gobbo in the south is claiming to be the new prophet, denouncing Wurrzag as an "air-a-tick" and "pretenda"!

All night, Wurrzag remained silent and still, the half-eaten Snotling frantically trying to prise the Savage Orc’s jaws apart. When the Shaman came to, and finally emptied his mouth with a big gulp, he immediately gathered the tribe and told them of what he had seen.

She knows, in this moment, that this was no mere nightmare but a vision - sent by the Lady - of what could be, should her strength be insufficient to stop it.

They are so many, it is as if a great cloak is reaching across the ocean. Panic grips the people, but the Enchantress remains calm.\n\nUpon the shores, she grasps the Chalice of Potions and channels its power in the name of the Lady. The ritual draws power from the swirling and tumultuous Winds of Magic, conjuring a dark and vicious storm. Bolts of lightning arc down at the approaching fleet, dashing them to pieces, whilst winds of enormous magnitude hurl yet more ships away to a watery demise. The spell is beyond anything ever seen before, and far greater than the one in the Enchantress' vision. When it is done, most of the fleet is consigned to oblivion. Yet despite it all, more advance. A sizeable force lands upon Bretonnian shores, still intent on seeing the land burn.\n\nThe Enchantress knows what must be done.

The fact that the enemy are searching over a large area, and in libraries as well as tombs, suggests that they are yet to discover the amulet's precise location. However, they seem to be concentrating their efforts within the eastern realms and this provides a clue. Balthasar Gelt advises the Emperor that the search would best be orchestrated by the Colleges of Magic.

Every eight years, a wizard who has proven himself worthy may challenge the Master of the Colleges to a magical duel, with the winner becoming the next Supreme Patriarch. The competition even to become a candidate is white hot. Wizards, being what they are, mean the selection process is at best pedantic; at its worst, real enmities can develop. Balthasar Gelt is the Patriarch of the Gold Order, and tipped to win, but a rival Light Wizard, Gottfried Orr, desperate for the position, wants rid of Gelt before they even reach the Hall of Duels. While this is an open secret, no direct accusation can be made as that is not how wizards manage their affairs. However, Gelt is something of a maverick and knows he needs the edge when Orr inevitably makes his move. As such, the Gold Wizard sets about locating a valuable lodestone and harnessing its power. Lodestones sometimes occur in areas struck by lightning - areas such as Kislev, which has recently experienced heavy storm activity.

Such greatness of spirit is a noble thing for most men, but to Kemmler it represents only a potential source of power waiting to be tapped. Marbad's tomb will doubtless contain vestiges of his spirit, and Kemmler intends to bend this to his own purposes.

It is a major centre of worship for the nature god, Taal, and is therefore worthy of destruction in Kemmler’s eyes. More significantly, it serves as a repository for several powerful artefacts. Unfortunately, the abbey is well defended by the forces of the local Duke, meaning that any straightforward attack upon it would prove costly. Fortunately the Lichemaster has a plan of pleasingly wicked deviousness. First of all he requires raw materials.

He takes up the dark puppet strings of Necromancy and soon a band of Empire troops stands before him once more with only the odd spatter of gore and their dead eyes betraying their true nature. With a rasping chuckle, Kemmler sets off for Axe Bite Pass, the main route through the Grey Mountains for pilgrims travelling to the abbey. Once there, he intends to have his new ‘Empire recruits’ waylay pilgrims as they make their way through the pass. Once word of this supposed aggression reaches the Abbey, it would be strange if there is no response, and Kemmler will be ready to capitalise on the ensuing strife.

Grombrindal, helped himself to another flagon and downed it in one.

His anger rises - who would dare rob the White Dwarf of Greenskins to slay?\n\nThe answer comes quickly. Sat on a pile of Orc corpses, drinking ale from a fine horn is a half-naked Dwarf sporting a massive slice of crescent-shaped hair, it is none other than Gotrek Gurnisson! The Slayer nods a greeting as Grombrindal sits down beside him. Gotrek offers the horn, and the White Dwarf drinks mightily - although it is a thirst not truly earned. The two legends share a few words, and Gotrek makes to leave soon after, for he has an umgi poet to find. He does offer some sage advice before disappearing into the night: the Warboss at the centre of this Waaagh! is gathering together a mighty horde of monsters. Gurnisson suggests he recruit a  group of Slayers he can vouch for. Gotrek would join himself, but this umgi partner of his seems to be missing and no doubt needs to rescued.\n\nThe meeting of two great Dawi heroes ends, and Grombrindal sets out to find the Slayers.
